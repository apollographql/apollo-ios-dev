  ///   `record.fields` (found); the rest were asked about but came
  ///   back missing (known-missing). The reader merges new fields
  ///   into the existing record and unions new field names into
  ///   `attempted` on subsequent flushes. The `attempted` set is the
  ///   load-bearing distinction in this case: `loadFields(_:)` only
  ///   returns the fields the caller asked about, so an un-attempted
  ///   field on a `.loaded` record might still exist in the cache and
  ///   warrants a re-batch.
  /// - ``absent`` — the cache had no record for this key. Sticky
  ///   until something explicitly invalidates the entry: the
  ///   store's read/write lock guarantees no concurrent writer can
  ///   surface a record under a key we already observed missing,
  ///   and an intra-transaction write to this key would route
  ///   through `invalidate(keys:)` which clears the entry. While
  ///   the entry survives, every field projection on this key —
  ///   same field or different — must short-circuit to the same
  ///   "absent" answer, so tracking which fields were attempted
  ///   would add no information.
  /// - ``failed(_:)`` — a prior flush threw for this key. Sticky
  ///   for the same reason as `.absent`: no concurrent mutation can
  ///   change the recorded outcome under us, and any explicit
  ///   in-transaction mutation routes through `invalidate(keys:)`
  ///   to clear the entry first. While the entry survives, every
  ///   subsequent projection on this key short-circuits as the
