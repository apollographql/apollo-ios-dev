| ☑️  Apollo Clients User Survey |
| :----- |
| What do you like best about Apollo iOS? What needs to be improved? Please tell us by taking a [one-minute survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczNDXfJne3ZUOXjk9Ursm9JYvhTh1_nFTDfdq3XBAFWCzplQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1170701325=Apollo+iOS&entry.204965213=Readme). Your responses will help us understand Apollo iOS usage and allow us to serve you better. |

### Apollo iOS Codegen

This repo provides the code necessary to do GraphQL code generation for the [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) library. The codegen cli is available as part of the Apollo iOS package, so if you plan to use the cli for doing code generation you will only need that package.

However, if you plan to handle your code generation through Swift scripting, you will now need to include the `apollo-ios-codegen` package as a dependency as it is no longer packaged as part of `apollo-ios`. In order to get start with scripting your code generation check out our guide [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/code-generation/run-codegen-in-swift-code).

## Issues

To report an issue, bug, or feature request you can do so in the [apollo-ios](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues) repo.

## Releases and changelog

Release of the Apollo iOS Codegen repo are tied to the releases of the [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) repo.

[All releases](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/releases) are catalogued and we maintain a [changelog](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) which details all changes to the library.

## Roadmap

The [roadmap](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) is a high-level document that describes the next major steps or milestones for this project. We are always open to feature requests, and contributions from the community.

## Who is Apollo?

[Apollo](https://apollographql.com/) builds open-source software and a graph platform to unify GraphQL across your apps and services. We help you ship faster with:

- [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/studio/develop/) – A free, end-to-end platform for managing your GraphQL lifecycle. Track your GraphQL schemas in a hosted registry to create a source of truth for everything in your graph. Studio provides an IDE (Apollo Explorer) so you can explore data, collaborate on queries, observe usage, and safely make schema changes.
- [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-federation) – The industry-standard open architecture for building a distributed graph. Use Apollo’s gateway to compose a unified graph from multiple subgraphs, determine a query plan, and route requests across your services.
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-client/) – The most popular GraphQL client for the web. Apollo also builds and maintains [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) and [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin).
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) – A production-ready JavaScript GraphQL server that connects to any microservice, API, or database. Compatible with all popular JavaScript frameworks and deployable in serverless environments.
