title: "8. Paginate results"
---

As you might have noticed, the object returned from the `LaunchListQuery` is a `LaunchConnection`. This object has a list of launches, a pagination cursor, and a boolean to indicate whether more launches exist.

When using a cursor-based pagination system, it's important to remember that the cursor gives you a place where you can get all results after a certain spot, regardless of whether more items have been added in the interim.

In the previous section, you hardcoded the `SMALL` size argument directly in the GraphQL query, but you can also define arguments programmatically using variables. You will use them here to implement pagination.

## Add a `cursor` variable

In `LaunchList.graphql`, add a `cursor` variable. In GraphQL, variables are prefixed with the dollar sign.

```graphql title="LaunchList.graphql"
query LaunchList($cursor: String) { # highlight-line
  launches(after: $cursor) { # highlight-line
    hasMore
    cursor
    launches {
      id
      site
      mission {
        name
        missionPatch(size: SMALL)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now re-run code generation to update the GraphQL code.

You can experiment with GraphQL variables in Sandbox Explorer by using the pane under the main body of the operation named **Variables**. If you omit the `$cursor` variable, the server returns data starting from the beginning:

## Update `LaunchListViewModel` to use `cursor`

First, you need to hang on to the most recently received `LaunchConnection` object.

Add a variable to hold on to this object, as well as a variable for the most recent request,  at the top of the `LaunchListViewModel.swift` file near your `launches` variable:

```swift title="LaunchListViewModel.swift"
@Published var launches = [LaunchListQuery.Data.Launches.Launch]()
@Published var lastConnection: LaunchListQuery.Data.Launches? // highlight-line
@Published var activeRequest: Bool = false // highlight-line
@Published var appAlert: AppAlert?
@Published var notificationMessage: String?
```

Next, let's update our `loadMoreLaunches()` method to use the `cursor` property as well as manage the `lastConnection` and `activeRequest` properties:

```swift title="LaunchListViewModel.swift"
private func loadMoreLaunches(from cursor: String?) async { // highlight-line
        defer { // highlight-line
            activeRequest = false // highlight-line
        } // highlight-line
        
        do {
            activeRequest = true // highlight-line
            let response = try await ApolloClient.shared.fetch(query: LaunchListQuery(cursor: cursor ?? .null))
            
            if let errors = response.errors {
                appAlert = .errors(errors: errors)
            }
            
            if let launchConnection = response.data?.launches {
                lastConnection = launchConnection // highlight-line
                launches.append(contentsOf: launchConnection.launches.compactMap({ $0 }))
            }
        } catch {
            appAlert = .errors(errors: [error])
        }
    }
```

Now implement the `loadMoreLaunchesIfTheyExist()` method to check if there are any launches to load before attempting to load them. Replace the `TODO` with the following code:

```swift title="LaunchListViewModel.swift"
func loadMoreLaunchesIfTheyExist() async {
    guard !activeRequest else { return }
    
    guard let connection = self.lastConnection else {
        await self.loadMoreLaunches(from: nil)
        return
    }
    
    guard connection.hasMore else {
        return
    }
    
    await self.loadMoreLaunches(from: connection.cursor)
}
```

## Update UI Code

Next, go to `LaunchListView` and update our task to call the newly implemented `loadMoreLaunchesIfTheyExist()` method:

```swift title="LaunchListView.swift"
.task {
    viewModel.loadMoreLaunchesIfTheyExist() // highlight-line
}
```

Now update the `List` to optionally add a button to load more launches at the end of the list:

```swift title="LaunchListView.swift"
List {
    ForEach(0..<viewModel.launches.count, id: \.self) { index in
        LaunchRow(launch: viewModel.launches[index])
    }
    if viewModel.lastConnection?.hasMore != false { // highlight-line
        if !viewModel.activeRequest { // highlight-line
            Button(action: { // highlight-line
                Task { // highlight-line
                    await viewModel.loadMoreLaunchesIfTheyExist() // highlight-line
                } // highlight-line
            }, label: { // highlight-line
                Text("Tap to load more") // highlight-line
            }) // highlight-line
        } else { // highlight-line
            Text("Loading...") // highlight-line
        } // highlight-line
    }
}
```

## Test pagination

Build and run the app, when you scroll to the bottom of the list you should see a row that says `Tap to load more`

<img src="images/tap_to_load_more.png" alt="Tap to load more" class="screenshot" height="600"/>

When you tap that row, the next set of launches will be fetched and loaded into the list. If you continue this process eventually the `Tap to load more` button will no longer be displayed because all launches have been loaded.

<img src="images/tap_to_load_more_results.png" alt="Tap to load more" class="screenshot" height="600"/>

Next, you'll [complete the details view](tutorial-complete-details-view) that will allow you to book a seat on a launch.
