description: Enabling file uploads in Apollo Client for iOS
---

Apollo iOS supports file uploads via the [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) with a few caveats:

- Uploading files with GraphQL is most often suitable for proof-of-concept applications. In production, using purpose-built tools for file uploads may be preferable. Refer to this [blog post](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/backend/file-uploads/file-upload-best-practices/) for the advantages and disadvantages of multiple approaches.
- The [Apollo Router](/router/) doesn't support `multipart/form-data` uploads.

### Uploading files with Apollo iOS

Apollo iOS only supports uploads for a single operation, not for batch operations. You can upload multiple files with a single operation if your server supports it, though.

To upload a file, you need:

- A `NetworkTransport` which also supports the `UploadingNetworkTransport` protocol on your `ApolloClient` instance. If you're using `RequestChainNetworkTransport` (which is set up by default), this protocol is already supported.
- The correct `MIME` type for the data you're uploading. The default value is `application/octet-stream`.
- Either the data or the file URL of the data you want to upload.
- A mutation which takes an `Upload` as a parameter. Note that this must be supported by your server.

Here is an example of a GraphQL query for a mutation that accepts a single upload, and then returns the `id` for that upload:

```graphql
mutation UploadFile($file:Upload!) {
    singleUpload(file:$file) {
        id
    }
}
```

If you want to use this to upload a file called `a.txt`, it looks something like this:

```swift
// Create the file to upload
guard let fileURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "a", withExtension: "txt"),
      let file = GraphQLFile(
        fieldName: "file", // Must be the name of the field the file is being uploaded to
        originalName: "a.txt",
        mimeType: "text/plain", // <-defaults to "application/octet-stream"
        fileURL: fileURL
) else {
  // Either the file URL couldn't be created or the file couldn't be created.
  return
}

// Actually upload the file
client.upload(
  operation: UploadFileMutation(file: "a"), // <-- `Upload` is a custom scalar that's a `String` under the hood.
  files: [file]
) { result in
  switch result {
  case .success(let graphQLResult):
    print("ID: \(graphQLResult.data?.singleUpload.id)")
  case .failure(let error):
    print("error: \(error)")
  }
}
```

A few other notes:

- Due to some limitations around the spec, whatever the file is being added for should be at the root of your GraphQL query. So if you have something like:

    ```graphql
    mutation AvatarUpload($userID: GraphQLID!, $file: Upload!) {
      id
    }
    ```

    it will work, but if you have some kind of object encompassing both of those fields like this:

    ```graphql
    # Assumes AvatarObject(userID: GraphQLID, file: Upload) exists
    mutation AvatarUpload($avatarObject: AvatarObject!) {
      id
    }
    ```

    it will not. Generally you should be able to deconstruct upload objects to allow you to send the appropriate fields.

- If you are uploading an array of files, you need to use the same field name for each file. These will be updated at send time.
- If you are uploading an array of files, the array of `String`s passed into the query must be the same number as the array of files.
