title: Apollo iOS 1.5 migration guide
description: From 1.3 - 1.4 to 1.5
---

This guide describes the process of migrating your code from version 1.3 or 1.4 to version 1.5 of Apollo iOS.

## Key Changes

Version 1.5 is a minor version bump, and will require no migration for most users.

* For users using the standard `ApolloClient` class, this version will be a seamless upgrade with no changes to your existing code required.
* **For users with custom client implementations that conform to `ApolloClientProtocol`, a simple migration is required.**

While we strive to make the upgrade path for minor versions seamless, these improvements could not be made without requiring this migration. For those users affected, follow this migration guide to update to 1.5.

### Request Context

1.5 added the ability pass a custom request context to networking APIs. The `fetch`, `watch, `perform`, `upload` or `subscribe` methods now accept an optional `RequestContext` parameter which is used to construct the request and is then available to any interceptor in the interceptor request chain.

If you had code that conformed to `ApolloClientProtocol` like the example below:

```swift title="v1.5 migration example"
class MyCustomClient : ApolloClientProtocol {
  public func fetch<Query: GraphQLQuery>(
    query: Query,
    cachePolicy: CachePolicy = .default,
    contextIdentifier: UUID? = nil,
    queue: DispatchQueue = .main,
    resultHandler: GraphQLResultHandler<Query.Data>? = nil
  ) -> Cancellable {
    ..
  }

  // other ApolloClientProtocol methods
}
```

You would simply have to add the new property to the method definition:

```swift title="v1.5 migration example"
class MyCustomClient : ApolloClientProtocol {
  public func fetch<Query: GraphQLQuery>(
    query: Query,
    cachePolicy: CachePolicy = .default,
    contextIdentifier: UUID? = nil,
    context: RequestContext? = nil,
    queue: DispatchQueue = .main,
    resultHandler: GraphQLResultHandler<Query.Data>? = nil
  ) -> Cancellable {
    ..
  }

  // other ApolloClientProtocol methods
}
```
