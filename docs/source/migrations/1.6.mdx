title: Apollo iOS 1.6 migration guide
description: From 1.5 to 1.6
---

This guide describes the process of migrating your code from version 1.5 to version 1.6 of Apollo iOS. Please follow the relevant migration guides if you're on a version other than 1.5.

## Apollo Codegen SPM Package

The 1.6 update restructured the Apollo iOS ecosystem by splitting the code up into multiple different repositories/packages. One of these changes was the creation of the new `apollo-ios-codegen` repo and SPM package for users who want to do their code generation through Swift vs using the CLI tool.

> **Note:** If you use the CLI tool for code generation, this change does not affect you. For more information on the project restructuring in the 1.6 release see [this](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues/3240) GitHub issue.

If you are doing your code generation through Swift you have something like the following in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift title="Package.swift"
let package = Package(
  name: "MyCodegen",
  platforms: [.macOS(.v10_15)],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios", exact: "1.5.0")
  ],
  targets: [
    .executableTarget(
      name: "MyCodegen",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "ApolloCodegenLib", package: "apollo-ios"),
      ],
      path: "Sources"),
  ]
)
```

In order to keep your code building successfully in the 1.6 release you will need to use the new `apollo-ios-codegen` package instead of the `apollo-ios` package:

```swift title="Package.swift"
let package = Package(
  name: "MyCodegen",
  platforms: [.macOS(.v10_15)],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios-codegen", exact: "1.6.0")
  ],
  targets: [
    .executableTarget(
      name: "MyCodegen",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "ApolloCodegenLib", package: "apollo-ios-codegen"),
      ],
      path: "Sources"),
  ]
)
```
