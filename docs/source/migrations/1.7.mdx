title: Apollo iOS 1.7 migration guide
description: From 1.6 to 1.7
---

This guide describes the process of migrating your code from version 1.6 to version 1.7 of Apollo iOS. Please follow the relevant migration guides if you're on a version other than 1.6.

## Affected Users

Version 1.7 is a minor version bump, and will require no migration for most users.

* For users using the Apollo Codegen CLI to run their code generation, this version will be a seamless upgrade with no changes to your existing code required.
* **For users that are using the ApolloCodegenLib directly to run code generation from a Swift executable, a simple migration is required.**

While we strive to make the upgrade path for minor versions seamless, these improvements could not be made without requiring this migration. For those users affected, follow this migration guide to update to 1.7.

## `ApolloCodegenLib` now uses Swift Concurrency

To improve the performance of the code generation, the `ApolloCodegenLib` now uses `async/await`. Code generation is now parallelized and should complete much faster for users with a large number of GraphQL files.

This means that the entry point function, `ApolloCodegen.build(with configuration:)` is now an `async` function. You will need to make your call sites into this function use `async/await`.  In most cases, this requires minimal code changes.

### Using `async/await` in a Swift executable

This migration guide will provide an example of how to migrate a Swift executable target that uses [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser). While you can use the `ApolloCodegenLib` and build a Swift executable without it, [swift-argument-parser](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser) usage is recommended.

To migrate your code you will need to make a few changes:

1. Change your `ParsableCommand` to an `AsyncParseableCommand`
2. Make your `run()` function `async`
3. `await` on the `ApolloCodegen.build(with configuration:)` function call

Consider the following example executable:

```swift title="v1.6 CustomCodegenScript.swift"
import Foundation
import ApolloCodegenLib
import ArgumentParser

@main
struct CustomCodegenScript: ParsableCommand {
    func run() throws {
      let codegenConfiguration = ApolloCodegenConfiguration(
        schemaNamespace: "MySchema",
        input: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.FileInput(
          schemaPath: "./myschema.graphqls",
          operationSearchPaths: ["./GraphQLFiles/**/*.graphql"]
        ),
        output: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.FileOutput(
          schemaTypes: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.SchemaTypesFileOutput(
            path: ./Generated/Schema,
            moduleType: .swiftPackageManager
          ),
          operations: .inSchemaModule
        )
      )

      try ApolloCodegen.build(with: codegenConfiguration)
    }
}
```

You can make this executable command support Swift Concurrency by changing it to:

```swift title="v1.7 CustomCodegenScript.swift"
import Foundation
import ApolloCodegenLib
import ArgumentParser

@main
struct CustomCodegenScript: AsyncParsableCommand {
    func run() async throws {
      let codegenConfiguration = ApolloCodegenConfiguration(
        schemaNamespace: "MySchema",
        input: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.FileInput(
          schemaPath: "./myschema.graphqls",
          operationSearchPaths: ["./GraphQLFiles/**/*.graphql"]
        ),
        output: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.FileOutput(
          schemaTypes: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.SchemaTypesFileOutput(
            path: ./Generated/Schema,
            moduleType: .swiftPackageManager
          ),
          operations: .inSchemaModule
        )
      )

      try await ApolloCodegen.build(with: codegenConfiguration)
    }
}
```

### Replace use of `main.swift` with `@main`

Notice in the example above, the command struct uses the `@main` annotation. Some projects may instead use a `main.swift` file in which they run a root command.

```swift title="v1.6 main.swift"
import Foundation
import ApolloCodegenLib
import ArgumentParser

struct CustomCodegenScript: ParsableCommand {
    func run() throws {
      let codegenConfiguration = ApolloCodegenConfiguration(
        schemaNamespace: "MySchema",
        input: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.FileInput(
          schemaPath: "./myschema.graphqls",
          operationSearchPaths: ["./GraphQLFiles/**/*.graphql"]
        ),
        output: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.FileOutput(
          schemaTypes: ApolloCodegenConfiguration.SchemaTypesFileOutput(
            path: ./Generated/Schema,
            moduleType: .swiftPackageManager
          ),
          operations: .inSchemaModule
        )
      )

      try ApolloCodegen.build(with: codegenConfiguration)
    }
}

CustomCodegenScript.main()
```

`main.swift` file usage is not compatible with `AsyncParsableCommand`. You will need to:

1. Change the name of the file to something other than `main.swift`
2. Add the `@main` annotation to the root command of your executable
3. Remove the call to your script's `main()` function.

The `run()` function of the command marked with `@main` will automatically be called when you run your Swift executable target.
