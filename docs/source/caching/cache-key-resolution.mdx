title: Custom cache keys
---

When working with a [normalized cache](./introduction#what-is-a-normalized-cache), it is recommended that you specify a **cache ID** for each object type in your schema. If you don't, objects are assigned a *default* cache ID, but that ID can lead to undesirable duplication of data.

The normalized cache computes a **cache key** for each object that is stored in the cache. With Apollo iOS, you can customize the computation of **cache keys** to improve the performance and capabilities of your cache.

> To learn more, read about how the cache [normalizes objects by cache key](./introduction#normalizing-objects-by-cache-key).

For most use cases, you can configure cache keys declaratively using the methods described on this page. For advanced use cases not supported by declarative cache keys, you can configure cache keys [programmatically](./programmatic-cache-keys).

## Schema extensions

Declarative cache keys work by adding directives to your backend schema types to indicate how cache keys should be resolved for those types. To do this, you can extend your backend schema by creating a schema extension file with the file extension `.graphqls`. You can add any number of schema extension files to your project.

<Note>

Make sure you include your schema extension files in the `schemaSearchPaths` of your code generation configuration's [`FileInput`](./../code-generation/codegen-configuration#file-input).

</Note>

## The `@typePolicy` directive

The `@typePolicy` directive lets you specify an object's cache ID using [key fields](#key-fields) of the object returned by your GraphQL server. You can apply `@typePolicy` to both concrete object types and interface types in your schema.

To declare a type policy, extend the type with the `@typePolicy` directive in a `.graphqls` schema extension file.

### Key fields

The `@typePolicy` directive has a single `keyFields` argument, which takes a string indicating the fields used to determine a type's cache key.

```graphql title="typePolicies.graphqls" showLineNumbers=false
extend type Book @typePolicy(keyFields: "id")
```

If you add the above schema extension file , Apollo iOS resolves the cache key for all objects with a `__typename` of `"Book"` by using the value of their `id` field. The concrete type of the object is always prepended to the cache key. This means that a `Book` object with an `id` of `456` will resolve to have a cache key of `Book:456`.

<Note>

All of a type's `@typePolicy` key fields must return a scalar type. To use non-scalar fields in cache keys, use [programmatic cache key configuration](./programmatic-cache-keys).

</Note>

### Multiple key fields

You can specify _multiple_ key fields for an object if they are all required to uniquely identify a particular cache entry. Separate multiple key fields with a single space when declaring them:

```graphql title="typePolicies.graphqls"
extend type Author @typePolicy(keyFields: "firstName lastName")
```

With this extension, the resolved cache key includes all declared key fields and separates them by the `+` character. In this case, an `Author` object with a `firstName` of `"Ray"` and a last name of `"Bradbury"` would resolve to have a cache key of `Author:Ray+Bradbury`.

### Type policies on interface types

You can also use `@typePolicy` on interface types. Doing so specifies a default set of key fields for all types that implement that interface.

```graphql title="extra.graphqls"
extend interface Node @typePolicy(keyFields: "id")
```

<Note>

Overriding type policies is not currently supported. If an object type has a `@typePolicy`, it must match any type policies of any interfaces the object type implements.

</Note>

## Caveats and limitations

Declarative cache key resolution has a few limitations you should be aware of while implementing your `@typePolicy` directives:

### Conflicting Type Policies

If any type implements two interfaces with conflicting type policies, Apollo iOS throws a validation error when executing code generation.

### Cache Inconsistencies

When an object is returned for a field of an interface type where the interface has a `@typePolicy`, Apollo iOS will first attempt to find a `@typePolicy` for the concrete type by using the `__typename` field of the returned object. If the type does not have an `@typePolicy` of its own, the interface's `@typePolicy` will be applied.

If the same object is returned for multiple fields of different interface types with conflicting type policies, it is possible that the same object is resolved with two different type policies, leading to cache inconsistencies.

In most circumstances, validation that is run during code generation prevents this from occurring. However, this may still occur if changes are made to the schema after code generation runs or after your application is published.

This is possible if:

  A) A type is added to your schema after code generation is executed and that type implements two different interfaces with different type policies

  B) Implementation of an interface is added to an existing type which already implements an interface with a different type policy

## The `@fieldPolicy` directive

The `@fieldPolicy` directive allows you to specify how cache keys should be resolved when querying a specific field. You can apply the `@fieldPolicy` directive to `Object` and `Interface` types in your schema by extending the type in a `.graphqls` schema extension file. You can also programmatically provide cache keys by implementing the `FieldPolicyProvider` protocol on your existing `SchemaConfiguration`.

The field policy feature is meant to be used in unison with type policies, meaning if you are using either the directive or programmatic field policy implementations you should be doing the same for type policy.

When executing an operation the library will first check programmatic cache keys, then for directive based cache keys, and then fallback to the default cache key implementation, `Protocol > Directive > Default`.


### Directive Usage

The `@fieldPolicy` directive has a `forField` and `keyArgs` argument to provide the name of the field on the type that you are adding the field policy to. As well as which input arguments of that field should be used to resolve cache keys, and in what order they should be used in the case of multiple key arguments. The format of the resolved cache key is the same with `@typePolicy` and looks like `{type name}:{value}`, when multiple key arguments are present they are joined with a `+` separator.

Given a type like this:
```graphql
type Query {
  allAnimals(species: String!): Animal!
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  species: String!
}
```

You would apply this field policy like this:
```graphql
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "allAnimals", keyArgs: "species")
```

This results in resolved cache keys that look like `Animal:Lion` or `Animal:Tiger`.

#### Multiple Key Arguments

When you have multiple key arguments, the are provided to the directive with a space delimiter. So when you have a type like this:
```graphql
type Query {
  allAnimals(species: String!, habitat: String!): Animal!
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  species: String!
  habitat: String!
}
```

You would apply this field policy like this:
```graphql
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "allAnimals", keyArgs: "species habitat")
```

This results in resolved cache keys that look like `Animal:Lion+Savanna`.

You can control the order of arguments in the cache key with the order you provide them in the directive, so this would result 
in a cache key that looks like `Animal:Savanna+Lion`:
```graphql
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "allAnimals", keyArgs: "habitat species")
```

#### List Arguments

The `@fieldPolicy` directive does support fields which return a list. There are a few caveats with the usage of lists:

- If a field has a list return type, it must contain exactly one list input parameter.
- Conversely if a list contains a list input parameter, it must return a list.
- Fields cannot have more than one list input parameter.
- Nested lists are not supported.
- Partial cache hits are not supported, so every cache key created from the input parameters must have a cache hit or the cache read will fail.

With a field like this:
```graphql
type Query {
  allAnimals(species: [String!], habitat: String!): [Animal!]
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  species: String!
  habitat: String!
}
```

You would apply this field policy like this:
```graphql
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "allAnimals", keyArgs: "species habitat")
```

If your inputs are `["Lion", "Elephant"]` and `Savanna` your cache keys would be `Animal:Lion+Savanna` and `Animal:Elephant+Savanna`, these
will be used to retrieve objects from the cache and populate the list to return from the field.

#### Object Arguments

It is possible to use `Input Object` as the type for you input parameters on a field. In cases like this you can use a dot notation syntax to traverse
into the structure of the object for the value you wish to have used as part of your cache key.

With a type like this:
```graphql
type Query {
  allAnimals(input: QueryInput!): Animal!
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  species: String!
  habitat: String!
}

input QueryInput {
  id: ID!
  species: String!
}
```

You could apply a field policy like this:
```graphql
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "allAnimals", keyArgs: "input.species")
```

This would result in cache keys like `Animal:Lion` or `Animal:Elephant`.

### Protocol Usage

If your prefer to have more control over the formatting of your cache keys you can implement the `FieldPolicyProvider` protocol on your 
existing `SchemaConfiguration`. The protocol contains two functions to implement, one for fields that return a single instance, and one 
for fields that return a list.

```swift
static func cacheKey(for field: Selection.Field, variables: GraphQLOperation.Variables?, path: ResponsePath) -> CacheKeyInfo?

static func cacheKeyList(for listField: Selection.Field, variables: GraphQLOperation.Variables?, path: ResponsePath) -> [CacheKeyInfo]?
```

The cache keys provided by these functions will be added to the typename of the return value. for instance with this field:
```graphql
type Query {
  allAnimals(species: String!): Animal!
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  species: String!
}
```

The cache key would be `Animal:{your custom cache key}`.

<Note>

The `FieldPolicyProvider` protocol MUST be implemented on `SchemaConfiguration` or it will not work.
