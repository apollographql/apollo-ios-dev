title: Programmatic Cache Keys
---

When [declarative cache IDs](./cache-key-resolution) don't fit your use case, you can programmatically generate cache IDs for object types in your normalized cache.

To configure cache keys programmatically, you can alter the [`SchemaConfiguration.cacheKeyInfo(for type:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)) method to return a `CacheKeyInfo` object.

<Note>

Programmatic cache key usage will take precedence over declarative cache keys. If you return a `CacheKeyInfo` for an object, it will be used to compute that object's cache key and any relevant `@typePolicy` will be ignored. Returning `nil` from this function will still fall back to using declarative cache keys.

</Note>

## `CacheKeyInfo`

The information needed to construct a **cache key** is represented by a [`CacheKeyInfo`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/cachekeyinfo) value. This `struct` consists of two properties you can provide to determine how a cache key is computed:

1. `let uniqueKeyGroup: String?`

    An optional **group identifier** for a set of objects that should be grouped together in the normalized cache. This is used as the first component of the **cache key**.

    <Caution>

    To ensure cache key group uniqueness, all objects with the same `uniqueKeyGroup` must have unique `id`s across all types.

    </Caution >

    To prevent cache key collisions, cache keys will always have a **group identifier** component. When the `uniqueKeyGroup` is `nil` (the default value), the [`__typename`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-Name-Introspection) of the response object is used as the **group identifier**.

    If multiple distinct types can be grouped together in the cache, the `CacheKeyInfo` for each `Object` should have the same `uniqueKeyGroup`.

    <Tip>

    By grouping objects together, their **keys** in the normalized cache will have the same prefix. This allows you to search for cached objects in the same group by their cache `id`. To learn more, read about [direct cache access](./cache-transactions)

    </Tip>

2. `let id: String`

    The unique **cache ID** representing the object. This is used as the second component of the **cache key**.

    <Caution>

    To ensure cache ID uniqueness, the `id` must be deterministic and unique for all objects with the same **group identifier** (`__typename` or `uniqueKeyGroup`).

    That is, a response object for the same entity will always have the same key in the cache.  Different objects, even with the same group identifier, will always have distinct keys.

    </Caution>

The normalized cache constructs cache keys with the format:

`"${GroupIdentifier}:${CacheID}"`

Given the following a `CacheKeyInfo`:
```swift showLineNumbers=false
CacheKeyInfo(id: "123", uniqueKeyGroup: "Animal")
```
Apollo iOS would construct a cache key of `"Animal:123"`.

## The `SchemaConfiguration` file

The `SchemaConfiguration` file is your entry point to configuring **cache keys** for the types in your schema.

When Apollo iOS [generates code for your project](../code-generation/introduction), it will generate a set of metadata types representing the GraphQL schema for your application. One of these files is named `SchemaConfiguration.swift`.

 The code generation engine creates this file if it doesn't exist yet, but never overwrites an existing `SchemaConfiguration.swift` file. This means you can edit your schema configuration without those changes being overwritten on subsequent code generation runs.

<Tip>

You can configure the location of the generated schema types with the [`output.schemaTypes` option in your code generation configuration](./../code-generation/codegen-configuration).

</Tip>

## Specifying cache IDs

The `SchemaConfiguration` contains a [`cacheKeyInfo(for type:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)) function. This function provides you a JSON response `object` and the concrete `type` of the object represented by the response.

The `object` parameter provides a JSON response from either a network request or a cache hit.

The `type` parameter provides a strongly typed [`Object`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/object) type. This is a generated metadata type representing a concrete `type` in your GraphQL schema.

To configure how cache keys are computed from a response object, you can create and return [`CacheKeyInfo`](#cachekeyinfo) values from your implementation of [`cacheKeyInfo(for:object:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/schemaconfiguration/cachekeyinfo(for:object:)).

<Note>

When specifying **cache IDs**, make sure that you are always fetching the fields used to construct those IDs in your operations. Any response objects that don't contain the **cache ID** fields will not be able to be [merged via cache normalization](./introduction#normalizing-responses).

</Note>

### Using a default cache ID field

If your schema provides a common unique identifier across many of your objects types, you may want to use that field as the **cache ID** by default.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: ObjectData) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    guard let id = object["id"] as? String else {
        return nil
    }

    return CacheKeyInfo(id: id)
  }
}
```

If the JSON response `object` has no `id` field, the function returns `nil` and the cache will normalize the object using the [default response path normalization](./introduction#normalizing-responses).

#### JSON value convenience initializer

Alternatively, you can use the [`init(jsonValue:uniqueKeyGroup:)`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/cachekeyinfo/init(jsonvalue:uniquekeygroup:)) convenience initializer. This initializer attempts to use the value of a key in the JSON response, throwing an error if the key does not exist.

If you want to return `nil` when the value does not exist, you can use `try?`.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: ObjectData) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
  }
}
```

### Specifying cache IDs by `Object` type

If you would like to specify **cache IDs** differently for different types of objects, you can use the `type` parameter.

For an object of the type `Dog` with a unique key represented by an `id` field, you may implement cache key resolution as:

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: ObjectData) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    switch type {
    case Objects.Dog:
      return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])

      default:
      return nil
    }
  }
}
```

### Specifying cache IDs by abstract types

If object types sharing the same `interface` or `union` in your schema have the same cache key resolution strategy, you can resolve the key based on those abstract types.

The generated schema metadata includes `Interfaces` and `Unions` types that contain a list of all the abstract types used in your GraphQL schema.

For example, for a schema with `Dog` and `Cat` types that implement `interface Pet`, you may implement cache key resolution as:

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: ObjectData) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    if type.implements(Interfaces.Pet) {
      return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
    }

    return nil
  }
}
```

To instead configure cache key resolution based on a `union` type, use the union's [`possibleTypes`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apolloapi/union/possibletypes) property.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: ObjectData) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    if Unions.ClassroomPets.possibleTypes.contains(type) {
      return try? CacheKeyInfo(jsonValue: object["id"])
    }

    return nil
  }
}
```

### Grouping cached objects with `uniqueKeyGroup`

If your **cache IDs** values are guaranteed to be unique across a number of different types, you may want to group them together in the cache with a common [`uniqueKeyGroup`](#cachekeyinfo).

> See [`uniqueKeyGroup`](#cachekeyinfo) for more information on grouping cached objects.

For example, if all objects that implement `interface Animal` will have unique **cache IDs**, whether they are `Dog`, `Cat`, or any other type that implements `Animal`, they can share a `uniqueKeyGroup`.

```swift title="SchemaConfiguration.swift"
public enum SchemaConfiguration: ApolloAPI.SchemaConfiguration {
  static func cacheKeyInfo(for type: Object, object: ObjectData) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
    if type.implements(Interfaces.Pet) {
      return try? CacheKeyInfo(
        jsonValue: object["id"],
        uniqueKeyGroupId: Interfaces.Pet.name
      )
    }

    return nil
  }
}
```

## Caveats and limitations

Programmatic cache key resolution has a few notable quirks and limitations you should be aware of while implementing your cache key resolution function:

1. While the cache key for an object can use a field from another nested object, if the fields on the referenced object are changed in another operation, the cache key for the dependent object will not be updated. For nested objects that are not normalized with their own cache key, this will never occur, but if the nested object is an entity with its own cache key, it can be mutated independently. In that case, any other objects whose cache keys are dependent on the mutated entity will not be updated automatically. You must take care to update those entities manually with a cache mutation.

2. The `object` passed to this function represents data for an object in a specific operation model, not a type in your schema. This means that [aliased fields](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Field-Alias) will be keyed on their alias name, not the name of the field on the schema type.

3. The `object` parameter of this function is an `ObjectData` struct that wraps the underlying object data. Because cache key resolution is performed both on raw JSON (from a network response) and `SelectionSet` model data (when writing to the cache directly), the underlying data will have different formats. The `ObjectData` wrapper is used to normalize this data to a consistent format in this context.

## Programmatic field policy usage

When fetching a field with an argument, you can use a field policy to configure an expected cache key for the object that is derived from the values of the field's arguments. Field policies can be applied using the [`@fieldPolicy` directive](./cache-key-resolution#the-fieldpolicy-directive) or programmatically.

To add programmatic field policies, extend your existing `SchemaConfiguration` to conform to the `FieldPolicy.Provider` protocol.
The protocol requires you to implement two functions: one for fields that return a single instance and one for fields that return a list.

```swift
static func cacheKey(
  for field: FieldPolicy.Field,
  inputData: FieldPolicy.InputData,
  path: ResponsePath
) -> CacheKeyInfo? {
  // Assuming we've already checked to know we are operating on a field 'hero(heroInput: HeroInput): Hero'.
  // Below is how you can work with the 'FieldPolicy.InputData' to access argument values for creating a cache key.
  guard let heroInput: FieldPolicy.InputData = inputData["heroInput"],
  let name = heroInput["name"] as? String,
  let factionID = heroInput["factionID"] as? Int else {
    return nil
  }

  return CacheKeyInfo(id: "\(name)+\(factionID)")
}

static func cacheKeyList(
  for listField: Field,
  inputData: InputData,
  path: ResponsePath
) -> [CacheKeyInfo]? {
  // Assuming we've already checked to know we are operating on a field 'heroes(heroInput: HeroInput): [Hero]'.
  // Below is how you can work with the 'FieldPolicy.InputData' to access argument values for creating a list of cache keys.
  guard let heroInput: FieldPolicy.InputData = inputData["heroInput"],
  let names: FieldPolicy.InputListData = heroInput["names"],
  let factionID = heroInput["factionID"] as? Int else {
    return nil
  }

  var keys = [CacheKeyInfo]()
  for i in 0..<names.count {
    if let name = names[i] as? String {
      keys.append(CacheKeyInfo(id: "\(name)+\(factionID)"))
    }
  }
  return keys
}
```
