## Request Context

Sometimes you might need to perform actions, or make modifications, in a request chain interceptor that relies on information not available in the operation. Examples of this might be custom headers, authentication tokens, or specific behaviour for particular requests.

`RequestContext` is a flexible way to inject additional data during the lifecycle of a GraphQL request. As a marker protocol there is no specific context implementation which allows for maximum flexibility to satisfy a wide variety of complex needs. This context is attached to the request and available to request chain interceptors.

### Per-request Timeout

`RequestContextTimeoutConfigurable` is a request context specialization protocol used to configure the timeout of a `URLRequest`. A `RequestContext` object can conform to this protocol to provide a custom `requestTimeout` for an individual request.

This request timeout interval is used to set the `timeoutInterval` on a `URLRequest`. The timeout interval specifies the limit on the idle interval alloted to a request in the process of loading. This timeout is measured in seconds.

```swift
// Define your timeout context
struct TwoMinuteTimeoutContext: RequestContextTimeoutConfigurable {
  let requestTimeout: TimeInterval

  init() {
    self.requestTimeout = 120
  }
}

// Then pass it into the operation request
client.fetch(query: QueryOperation(), context: TwoMinuteTimeoutContext()) { result in
  ...
}
```
