The Apollo iOS SPM package includes the Codegen CLI as an executable target. This ensures you always have a valid CLI version for your Apollo iOS version.

To simplify accessing the Codegen CLI, you can run the included `InstallCLI` SPM plugin.

This plugin downloads the matching version of the CLI for the library version you are using.

If you use Swift packages through Xcode, you can right-click on your project in the Xcode file explorer, revealing an **Install CLI** plugin command. Selecting this command presents a dialog allowing you to grant the plugin "write" access to your project directory, as well as asking for network access to download the CLI tool.

After the plugin downloads it will be unpacked to your project root. You can now run the CLI from the command line with `./apollo-ios-cli`.
