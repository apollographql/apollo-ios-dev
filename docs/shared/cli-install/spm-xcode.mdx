The Apollo iOS SPM package includes the Codegen CLI as an executable target. This ensures you always have a valid CLI version for your Apollo iOS version.

To simplify accessing the Codegen CLI, you can run the included `InstallCLI` SPM plugin.

This plugin downloads the matching version of the CLI for the library version you are using.

If you use Swift packages through Xcode, right-click your project in the Xcode file explorer and select the **Install CLI** plugin command. A dialog prompts you to grant the plugin write access to your project directory and network access to download the CLI tool.

After the plugin downloads, it's unpacked to your project root. You can now run the CLI from the command line with `./apollo-ios-cli`.
